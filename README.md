# Pandas Challenge by Anqa Javed

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the **Pandas Challenge**. The challenge involves analyzing school performance data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. 

### Key Metrics Analyzed:
- **District Overview**: Analyzing district-wide key metrics such as total schools, total students, total budget, average scores, and passing rates.
- **School Summary**: Summarizing performance metrics for each school, including math and reading scores, passing rates, and per-student budget.
- **Highest and Lowest Performing Schools**: Sorting schools by their overall passing rates.
- **Math and Reading Scores by Grade**: Analyzing average test scores for each grade level.
- **Scores by School Spending, Size, and Type**: Analyzing how school performance varies by spending range, size (small, medium, large), and type (charter or public).

## Files
- **PyCitySchools.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with all calculations and analysis.
- **Resources/**: Directory containing the raw data files (`schools_complete.csv`, `students_complete.csv`).

## Key Findings:
- Charter schools tend to perform better than public schools, with higher average math and reading scores.
- Smaller schools (fewer than 1000 students) generally have higher passing rates compared to larger schools.
  
## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anqajaved/pandas-challenge.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pandas-challenge
    ```
3. Install the necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Conclusion
This challenge helped in understanding how to clean, merge, and analyze data using **Pandas**. I have applied key skills learned to identify trends in school performance based on various metrics, and this project can be used as a reference for future data analysis projects.
